# About

We're a community of gamers enjoying a range of casual and competitive games.

You're welcome to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/fpKA2HPV5f). We have regular game nights, roughly 3 nights a week (often more). We'll get a schedule going soon so we can plan around it.

**WARNING**, we swear a lot and have a lot of rather brutal banter. Please don't let that deter, we are an inclusive group.

## We play

- Valorant (our main game)
- GTFO (our secondary game)
- Golf With Your Friends (our chill game)

Sometimes we dabble in other titles:

- Escape from Tarkov
- Diablo III
- Overwatch
- Insurgency Sandstorm
- CS:GO
